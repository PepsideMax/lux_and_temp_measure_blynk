# lux_and_temp_measure_blynk
my test for week 5 sensros and interfacing where we have to use blynk to diaspaly the amount of lux and the current temperature

as sensors I have used the BH1750 to measure the ligth ans the BMP280 to measure temperature. as controller i chose for the esp32 becous i just like it a lot and its easyer to connect to the internet becaus there is an includdes wifi module onboard.
